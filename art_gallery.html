        <P>Warli painting is an ancient tribal art form from Maharashtra, India, characterized by its simple, geometric designs, primarily circles, triangles, and squares, on a mud or mud-like background. Traditionally using white rice paste, it depicts daily life, farming, hunting, festivals, and the interconnectedness of nature and the universe. The human figures are often represented by two inverted triangles joined at their tips, symbolizing balance, and the art form emphasizes the balance of the universe</P>
